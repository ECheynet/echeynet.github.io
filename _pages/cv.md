# Research Profile
My research focuses on atmospheric turbulence, wind engineering, and experimental meteorology, with applications in offshore wind energy, bridge aerodynamics, and atmospheric measurement techniques. I develop methods to characterize turbulence and map mean wind conditions in complex terrain and marine boundary layers. The work combines natural science and engineering and contributes to interdisciplinary efforts in wind energy and structural dynamics. Research topics include regulatory aspects of offshore wind development, full-scale structural monitoring, remote sensing of wind and the use of drone-based sensor systems for turbulence measurements. I emphasize collaboration, reproducibility, open data, and the practical applicability of research outcomes.

# Education
* **2013 – 2016** PhD, University of Stavanger (UiS), Stavanger, Norway  
* **2009 – 2012** MSc, École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et d’Aérotechnique (ISAE-ENSMA), Futuroscope Technopole, France  

# PhD thesis
* **Title :** Wind-induced vibrations of a suspension bridge: A case study in full-scale  
* **Supervisors :** Prof. Jasna B. Jakobsen and Prof. Jónas Snæbjörnsson  
* **Description :** The thesis examines the full-scale wind-induced vibrations of the Lysefjord Suspension Bridge in Rogaland, Norway. Since 2013 the bridge has been equipped with a wind and structural health-monitoring system. In May 2014 Doppler wind-lidar systems were installed at the bridge site to analyze the wind flow around the structure. This thesis presents a comprehensive validation of the buffeting theory through the integration of wind measurements and operational modal analysis.
